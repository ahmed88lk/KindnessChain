## üìö Islamic Foundation

The KindnessChain platform is built upon the teachings of the Quran and authentic hadiths, emphasizing kindness, compassion, and mercy. The concept is inspired by many Quranic verses about Allah's mercy, including:

> "Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'" ‚Äî Quran 39:53

Our guiding hadith for this platform is:

> "The merciful will be shown mercy by the Most Merciful. Be merciful to those on the earth, and the One in the heavens will have mercy upon you." ‚Äî Sunan al-Tirmidhƒ´ 1924 (Sahih)

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Our Mission

KindnessChain aims to create a more united and caring world by encouraging and amplifying acts of kindness based on Islamic values. We believe that small acts of kindness can have an enormous impact on our society and create virtuous cycles of compassion, as taught by our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

The Quranic verses and hadiths we share remind us of this universal truth: kindness is a language understood by everyone, regardless of cultural or linguistic barriers. Through peaceful interactions and mutual understanding, we can build a more harmonious world together.

As the Quran states:
> "And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds." ‚Äî Quran 21:107
